\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

\textbf{Background:} Assessing temporal variations in transmission in
different countries is essential for monitoring the epidemic, evaluating
the effectiveness of public health interventions and estimating the
impact of changes in policy.

\textbf{Methods:} We use case and death notification data to generate
daily estimates of the time-dependent reproduction number globally,
regionally, nationally, and subnationally over a 12 week rolling window.
Our modelling framework, based on open source tooling, accounts for
uncertain reporting delays, so that the reproduction number is estimated
based on underlying latent infections.

\textbf{Conclusions:} This decision-support tool can be used to assess
changes in virus transmission both globally, regionally, nationally, and
subnationally. This allows public health officials and policymakers to
track the progress of the outbreak in near real-time using an
epidemiologically valid measure. As well as providing regular updates on
our website, we also provide an open source tool-set so that our
approach can be used directly by researchers and policymakers on
confidential data-sets. We hope that our tool will be used to support
decisions in countries worldwide throughout the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic.

\textbf{Keywords}: Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, surveillance, forecasting,
time-varying reproduction number

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that emerged in
December 2019 has since spread to over 100 countries in every continent
except Antarctica. While some information on the progress of an outbreak
in a given country can be gained from the reported numbers of confirmed
cases and deaths, these numbers can obscure changes in the underlying
dynamics of the outbreak due to delays between infection and the
eventual reporting of a case or death. Accounting for the uncertain
delays from infection to symptom onset, and the uncertain delays from
symptom onset to hospital admission, diagnostic testing or potential
death, followed by further delays until data are recorded in official
statistics, requires the use of specific statistical methods for
handling right-truncated data {[}1--3{]},uncertainty, and the creation
of a ``nowcast'' {[}4,5{]} (an estimate of the current number of newly
infected or symptomatic cases).

A method for tracking the progress of an outbreak is to measure changes
in the time-varying reproduction number (effective reproduction number),
which represents the average number of secondary infections generated by
each new infectious case {[}6--8{]}. This approach can be advantageous
compared to monitoring numbers of newly reported or symptomatic cases
since, in principle, reproduction number estimates reflect variations in
transmission intensity. Due to the delays in disease progression,
recorded numbers of newly notified or symptomatic cases will increase or
decrease for a period after transmissibility has reduced or increased,
respectively. Monitoring changes in the time-varying reproduction can
account for this delay and reveals variations in transmissibility that
are not clear when using only reported cases.

This paper outlines the methods used to produce the website
(\url{https://epiforecasts.io/covid/}), and data resource {[}9{]}, we
have developed that presents real-time estimates and forecasts of
reported cases by date of infection and the respective time-varying
reproduction numbers globally, regionally, nationally and subnationally
for Covid-19. This website relies on methods implemented in the
\texttt{EpiNow2} R package and data aggregated in the
\texttt{covidregionaldata} R package, both developed by the authors
{[}10,11{]}. Our estimates overcome some of the limitations of naive
implementations that derive estimates for the reproduction number
directly from numbers of reported cases without adjusting (or with only
partial adjustments) for the delay from infection to symptom onset or
from onset to notification. Our approach also incorporates multiple
sources of uncertainty that if excluded can bias estimates. The code
that creates and updates the website is open source, and documented for
use by others, allowing policymakers and researchers to run analyses
using confidential data. The methods outlined in this paper and
corresponding code base are under development, and new versions of this
live article will be released alongside changes to the methods to create
a record of the methodology used throughout the pandemic.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

\hypertarget{data}{%
\subsection{Data}\label{data}}

We use daily counts of confirmed cases and deaths reported by the
European Centre for Disease Control from the last 12 weeks for all
analyses conducted at the national level {[}11,12{]}. To estimate the
delay from symptom onset to reporting (once confirmed with a positive
laboratory test), we use all cases from a publicly available linelist
for which onset and notification dates are available {[}11,13{]}. This
linelist combines all known linelist data from over 100 countries and at
the time of writing. Countries are only included in the reported
estimates if within the last 12 weeks they have fewer than 14 days with
non-zero case counts. This restriction reduces the likelihood of
spurious estimates for countries with limited transmission or case
ascertainment.

For sub-national analyses, the data is aggregated using the
\texttt{covidregionaldata} R package developed by the authors.
Individual data sources are reported on the respective pages of our
website. The data are fetched from government departments or from
individuals who maintain a data source if no official data are
available. Similarly to national estimates, subnational areas are only
included if they report at least 14 days with non-zero cases in the last
12 weeks.

All analyses described below are run daily for each national or
subnational entity under consideration. An automated timestamp is used
to evaluate if data has been updated since the last time estimates were
made in order to avoid repeatedly estimating based on the same data.

\hypertarget{delays-between-case-onset-and-report}{%
\subsection{Delays between case onset and
report}\label{delays-between-case-onset-and-report}}

To estimate the reporting delay (i.e the delay between onset and case
report or death) with appropriate uncertainty, we fit a log-normal
distribution, using use the statistical modelling program stan
{[}10,14{]}, to 100 subsampled bootstraps (each with 250 samples drawn
with replacement) of the available delay data. Accounting for left and
right censoring occurring in the data as each date is rounded to the
nearest day and truncated to the maximum observed delay. There was
insufficient data available on the various reporting delays to estimate
spatially- or temporally-varying delays whilst also accounting for the
biases induced by the growth rate of reported cases, so they were
considered to be static over the 12 weeks of data considered each day.

This results in an onset to case report delay distribution with a mean
of 2.6 days (standard deviation (SD): 1.2 days) and a standard deviation
of 4.4 days (SD: 1.1 days) and an onset to death report delay
distribution with a mean of 9.8 days (SD: 1.1 days) and a standard
deviation of 2.1 days (SD: 1.1 days). For computational reasons the
maximum allowed delay is set to be 30 days.

As data may also be right truncated due to unrecorded delays (i.e the
delay between a case report and its appearance in an aggregated data
set) we truncate all time-series to exclude the last 3 days of data,
based on qualitative inspection of the stability of case counts in the
data-sets used.

\hypertarget{estimating-the-time-varying-reproduction-number-and-nowcasting-reported-infections}{%
\subsection{Estimating the time-varying reproduction number and
nowcasting reported
infections}\label{estimating-the-time-varying-reproduction-number-and-nowcasting-reported-infections}}

We estimated the instantaneous reproduction number (\(R_t\)) using the
\texttt{EpiNow2} R package (version 1.2.0) {[}10{]} on the last 12 weeks
of available data, discarding estimates from the first 14 days globally,
for United Nation regions, nationally, and subnationally for 10
countries. The instantaneous reproduction number represents the number
of secondary cases arising from an individual showing symptoms at a
particular time, assuming that conditions remain identical after that
time, and is therefore a measure of the instantaneous transmissibility
(in contrast to the case reproduction number - see Fraser (2007) {[}8{]}
for a full discussion). \texttt{EpiNow2} implements a Bayesian latent
variable approach using the probabilistic programming language Stan
{[}14{]}, which works as follows. The initial number of infections were
estimated as a free parameter with a prior based on the initial number
of cases, or deaths, respectively. For each subsequent time step,
previous imputed infections were summed, weighted by an uncertain
generation time probability mass function, and combined with an estimate
of \(R_t\) to give the prevalence at time \(t\) {[}6,7,10{]}. We used a
log normal prior for the reproduction number with mean 1 and standard
deviation 1 reflecting our current belief that \(R_t\) is likely to be
centered around 1 in most of the world, with public health interventions
and individual behaviour combining to prevent it from growing
significantly larger for sustained periods. This contrasts with our
earlier approach which was to use a gamma prior with a of mean 2.6 and
standard deviation 2. This was based on early estimates for the basic
reproduction number (\(R_0\)) from the initial stages of the outbreak in
Wuhan {[}15,16{]} with long tails to allow for differences in the
reproduction number between countries. The infection trajectories were
then mapped to reported case counts by convolving over an uncertain
incubation period and report delay distribution, and a negative binomial
observation model combined with a multiplicative day of the week effect
(with an independent effect for each day of the week) {[}17{]}. Temporal
variation was controlled using an approximate Gaussian process {[}18{]}
with a squared exponential kernel, with the length scale and magnitude
estimated during the model fitting process. Each timeseries was fitted
independently using Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A minimum of 2
chains were used with a warmup of 500 each and 2000 samples post warmup.
Convergence was assessed using the R hat diagnostic {[}14{]}.

We used a gamma distributed generation time with mean 3.6 days (standard
deviation (SD) 0.7), and SD of 3.1 days (SD 0.8) for all estimates.
Sourced from {[}19{]} but refit using a log-normal incubation period
with a mean of 5.2 days (SD 1.1) and SD of 1.52 days (SD 1.1) {[}20{]}
rather than the incubation period used in the original study (code
available here: \url{https://github.com/seabbs/COVID19}). This
incubation period was also used to convolve from unobserved infections
to unobserved onsets in the model. See {[}10{]} for further details on
the approach.

\hypertarget{estimating-the-daily-growth-rate-and-doubling-time}{%
\subsection{Estimating the daily growth rate and doubling
time}\label{estimating-the-daily-growth-rate-and-doubling-time}}

We estimated the rate of spread (\(r\)) by converting our \(R_t\)
estimates using an approximation derived in {[}21{]}. The doubling time
was then estimated by calculating \(\text{ln}(2) \frac{1}{r}\) for each
estimate of the rate of spread.

\hypertarget{estimated-change-in-daily-cases}{%
\subsection{Estimated change in daily
cases}\label{estimated-change-in-daily-cases}}

We defined the estimated change in daily cases to correspond to the
proportion of reproduction number estimates for the current day that are
below 1 (the value at which an outbreak is in decline). It was assumed
that if less than 5\% of samples were subcritical then an increase in
cases was definite, if less than 20\% of samples were subcritical then
an increase in cases was likely, if more than 80\% of samples were
subcritical then a decrease in cases was likely and if more than 95\% of
samples were subcritical then a decrease in cases was definite. For
countries/regions with between 20\% and 80\% of samples being
subcritical we could not make a statement about the likely change in
cases (defined as unsure).

\hypertarget{the-effect-of-changes-in-testing-procedure}{%
\subsection{The effect of changes in testing
procedure}\label{the-effect-of-changes-in-testing-procedure}}

The results presented here are sensitive to changes in COVID-19 testing
practices and the level of effort put into detecting COVID-19 cases,
e.g.~through contact tracing. For example, if numbers of incident
infections remain constant but a country begins to find and report a
higher proportion of cases, then an increasing value of the reproduction
number will be inferred. This is because all changes in the number of
cases are attributed to changes in the number of infections resulting
from previously reported cases, and are not assumed to be a result of
improved testing and surveillance. On the other hand, if a country
reports a lower proportion of cases because a lower number of tests are
performed (which can happen if reagents required for testing are no
longer available, for example) or the surveillance system captures a
lower proportion of infections, then the model will attribute this to a
drop in the reproduction number that may not be a true reduction. In
order for our estimates to be unbiased not all cases have to be
reported, but the level of testing effort (and therefore the proportion
of detected cases) must be constant {[}22{]}. This means that, whilst a
change in testing effort will initially introduce bias, this will be
reduced over time as long as the testing effort remains consistent from
this point onwards.

Countries may also change the focus of their surveillance over the
course of the outbreak. They may initially focus on identifying
travellers returning from areas of known COVID-19 transmission and
performing contact tracing on the contacts of known cases. As the
outbreak evolves this may change to passive surveillance at hospitals.
Here, the case definition may also change from tests based on polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) to diagnoses based on symptoms and computed
tomography (CT) scans. In the future, different kinds of COVID-19 tests
may be deployed that could influence results, such as tests that detect
both active and past infections.

\hypertarget{forecasting-the-reproduction-number-and-case-counts-by-date-of-infection}{%
\subsection{Forecasting the reproduction number and case counts by date
of
infection}\label{forecasting-the-reproduction-number-and-case-counts-by-date-of-infection}}

We forecast the time-varying effective reproduction number over a 14 day
time horizon by assuming it remains the same as the last estimated
\(R_t\). The reproduction number forecast is then transformed into a
case forecast using the \texttt{EpiNow2} model outlined in the previous
section {[}10{]}. These forecasts are indicative only and should not be
considered with a weight equal to the real-time estimates. Changes in
contact rates, mobility, and public health interventions are not
accounted for which may lead to significant inaccuracy.

\hypertarget{reporting}{%
\subsection{Reporting}\label{reporting}}

We report the median and 90\% highest density credible intervals for all
measures with 20\%, 50\% and 90\% high density regions shown in figures.
The analysis was conducted independently for all regions and is updated
daily as new data becomes available. To highlight the proportion of
cases that have yet to be reported (due to correcting for right
truncation), we show a cut-off in figures based on the mean of all
delays. Values prior to this point are defined as estimates with values
past this point being defined as estimates based on partial data. In
reality, this is a continuum with estimates closer to now progressively
being based on less data and therefore becoming increasing uncertain.
All estimates are available as downloadable csvs under an open-source
license for use elsewhere {[}9{]}. The scheduling framework used to
update our estimates is also available under an open-source license
(\url{https://github.com/epiforecasts/covid-rt-estimate}).

\hypertarget{website-summarised-estimates-and-interactivity}{%
\subsection{Website, summarised estimates, and
interactivity}\label{website-summarised-estimates-and-interactivity}}

We use Rmarkdown templates and the distill framework to generate
webpages summarising these estimates {[}23,24{]}. The \texttt{RtD3}
package is used to provide interactive visualisations of all estimates
{[}25{]}. Estimates by country are provided on a dedicated static page
along with global, and regional, summaries. More detailed subnational
estimates are available for over 10 countries in an flexible framework
into which additional subnational estimates will be added as more data
becomes available.

\hypertarget{discussion}{%
\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}}

We provide a centralised resource, which generates comparable daily
estimates of the time-varying reproduction number and a daily nowcast of
the number of cases newly infected derived using a standardised method.
We account for the delay between infection and case notification and
include all sources of quantifiable uncertainty. This resource may be
useful for policymakers to track the progression of the COVID-19
outbreak and evaluate the effectiveness of intervention measures. As new
data become available, we will include sub-national estimates for
additional countries, and provide additional support for public health
agencies or researchers interested in applying our methods to their
data.

There are several advantages associated with our approach. Firstly,
reported counts are the only data required, which allows our approach to
be used in a wide variety of contexts. It can be applied separately to
counts of cases, hospital admissions, deaths or other metrics as long as
appropriate delay distributions are used {[}26{]}. As our methodology is
applied across a range of geographies our estimates can be compared
without having to consider differences in the underlying approach (even
if differences in testing should still be accounted for as discussed
below). Finally, we have constructed our approach using open source
tools and all of our code, raw data, and results are available online
and developed with other users in mind. This means our methods can be
readily applied by others to non-public data and be fully evaluated by
end users.

Our approach is also subject to several limitations. Firstly, the model
requires that the proportion of infections that are notified is constant
over the 12 weeks considered. In other words, it requires consistency in
the focus of the surveillance method, level of effort spent on testing,
and case definition. Yet it is often the case that the level of
under-reporting in a country changes over the course of an outbreak
{[}22{]}. However, it should be noted that any changes in surveillance
testing procedures will only bias the estimates temporarily if they
begin to remain consistent again after they have changed. How long the
bias remains in the reproduction number estimates will depend on the
serial generation time and delay distributions, as well as the length
scale of the Gaussian process used in the reproduction number estimation
process. The impact of testing and other reporting biases vary between
measures of transmission (test positive cases, hospital admissions, test
positive deaths) {[}26{]}. For this reason we include estimates based on
reported deaths and provide tooling to allow estimates to be produced
for alternative datasets. In theory, estimates from disparate sources
should be comparable using our approach, however if they in fact
represent different sub-populations then there may be variation between
them that can potentially be usefully interpreted.

In addition, the model is limited by how representative the delay that
we use from infection to notification distribution is for a given
location. As there is limited data to assess this, we estimate a
bootstrapped global delay distribution using the combined data from
every country. In particular, the delay from onset to notification can
especially impact the upscaling of cases by date of onset that accounts
for cases that have onset but not yet been reported. If the true delay
from onset to notification for a given country is shorter than our
global delay, then we will overestimate onset case numbers, and vice
versa for true delays longer than the distribution we used.
Additionally, estimates of the reporting delay distribution are known to
be biased early in an epidemic and may vary over time {[}27{]}. However,
our use of a bootstrapped subsampling approach mitigates these issues by
allowing multiple delay distributions based on the observed data to be
considered at the cost of increasing uncertainty in our estimates.

Our model is also limited by the data avaliable to us. For example, the
publically available linelists contain little data on the importation
status of cases. This means that cases counts may be biased upwards by
attributing imported cases to local transmission. This bias is
particularly problematic when case counts are low. Unfortunately, in the
absence of data, this issue can only be explored via scenario analysis.

As more data becomes available, future work should look to refine the
distributions used for generation time, incubation period, and the
report delay. There is also the potential to extend the present model to
account for chainges in the delay from onset to notification over the
course of an outbreak though additional data would need to be available
for this to be possible. Finally, there is scope to explore how outbreak
dynamics that differ among particular sub-populations, such as high-risk
COVID-19 patients, can bias overall reproduction number estimates. This
may be achieved by comparing reproduction number estimates from
disparate data sources such as test positive cases, hospital admissions,
and test positive deaths.

Our approach, providing real-time estimates of the reproduction number,
serves as a valuable tool for decision makers looking to track the
course of COVID-19 outbreaks. The nowcasts explicitly account for
delays, using the same methodology across all countries and sub-national
regions. These reproduction number estimates may also be used to
ascertain the likely outbreak trajectory if no policy interventions are
made. They can also provide real-time feedback on whether transmission
is decreasing following a particular intervention, or whether it is
increasing following the relaxing or lifting of current intervention
measures. We hope that our website and the related toolkit will provide
a valuable resource for devising strategies to contain COVID-19
outbreaks worldwide.
