## Aim

To identify changes in the reproduction number, rate of spread, and doubling time during the course of the COVID-19 outbreak at the national and subnational level whilst accounting for potential biases due to delays in case reporting.


## Summary

* Case counts by date, stratified by import status (local or imported), were constructed using the World Health Organization (WHO) situation reports and partial line-lists for each region [@WorldHealthOrganization:sitrep; @EricBrown2020; @kraemer2020epidemiological; @NCoVUtils].
* â€¢	Case onset dates were estimated by transforming case confirmation dates using an onset-to-confirmation delay distribution that is fitted to partial line-lists from each region considered (regions without linelists use the delay distribution from the nearest comparable region). 
* The right-censoring of cases that have had symptom onset but are yet to be confirmed was adjusted for by upscaling the numbers of case onsets close to the present date. This assumes that cases that have already onset are drawn from a binomial distribution with the probability of onset having occurred by a certain point given by the onset-to-confirmation distribution.
* Time-varying effective reproduction estimates were made with a 7-day sliding window using *EpiEstim* [@EpiEstim; @THOMPSON2019100356] adjusted for imported cases and assuming an uncertain serial interval with a mean of 4.7 days (95% CrI: 3.7, 6.0) and a standard deviation of 2.9 days (95% CrI: 1.9, 4.9) [@Nishiura2020.02.03.20019497].
* Time-varying estimates of the doubling time were made with a 7-day sliding window by iteratively fitting an exponential regression model. 

## Limitations

* All data used are at a national/regional level taken from WHO situation reports; diagnostic capabilities and testing protocols may vary in different parts of each country/region, adding uncertainty to the reported numbers. The true number of infections reflected in a given number of confirmed cases will vary substantially geographically.
* Estimated onset dates are derived using available data for the delay from symptom onset to confirmation, in many regions this data is only available during the beginning the outbreak. This early outbreak data may not be representative of the underlying delay distribution, which may also change over the course of the outbreak.
* The estimate of cases that have onset but are not yet confirmed, used to scale up recent confirmed case numbers, is uncertain and relies on the observed delays to confirmation remaining constant over the course of the outbreak.
* Trends identified using our approach are robust to under-reporting assuming that the level of reporting remains consistent over time, however absolute values may be biased by reporting rates. Pronounced changes in reporting rates may also impact the trends identified.
* Some regions did not have sufficient data available to estimate the reporting delay, in this case the reporting delay for the nearest comparable region was used. This introduces bias into the results if the true reporting delay differs from that which is assumed. The details of the data used in each region are listed in the methods.
* In many regions, data on imported cases were only partially available and often incomplete. This may bias reproduction number estimates upwards when overall case counts are low.
* Since our estimates are made at the date of symptom onset, the time until changes in the time-varying reproduction number are reflected in our estimates will be delayed by the incubation period (around 4-5 days on average).
