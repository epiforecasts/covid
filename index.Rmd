## Aim

To identify changes in the reproduction number, rate of spread, and doubling time during the course of the COVID-19 outbreak at the national and subnational level whilst accounting for potential biases due to delays in case reporting.


## Summary

* We used daily counts of confirmed cases reported by the European Centre for Disease Control for all analyses conducted at the national level [@ecdc_data; @NCoVUtils]. 
*	Case onset dates were estimated by transforming case confirmation dates using an onset-to-confirmation delay distribution that was derived using all cases from a publically available linelist for which onset and confirmation dates were available [@kraemer2020epidemiological; @NCoVUtils]. The date of infection was then assumed using a median incubation period of 5 days [@10.7326/M20-0504].
* The right-censoring of cases that have had symptom onset but are yet to be confirmed was adjusted for by upscaling the numbers of case onsets close to the present date. This assumes that cases that have already onset are drawn from a binomial distribution with the probability of onset having occurred by a certain point given by the onset-to-confirmation distribution.
* Time-varying effective reproduction estimates were made using *EpiEstim* [@EpiEstim; @THOMPSON2019100356] adjusted for imported cases, optimising the window using a one-day ahead nowcast, and assuming an uncertain serial interval with a mean of 4.7 days (95% CrI: 3.7, 6.0) and a standard deviation of 2.9 days (95% CrI: 1.9, 4.9) [@Nishiura2020.02.03.20019497].
* Time-varying estimates of the doubling time were made with a 7-day sliding window by iteratively fitting an exponential regression model. 

## Limitations

* Diagnostic capabilities and testing protocols may vary in different parts of each country/region, adding uncertainty to the reported numbers. The true number of infections reflected in a given number of confirmed cases will vary substantially geographically.
* Estimated onset dates are derived using available data for the delay from symptom onset to confirmation, in many regions this data is only available during the beginning the outbreak. This early outbreak data may not be representative of the underlying delay distribution, which may also change over the course of the outbreak.
* The estimate of confirmed cases that have onset but are not yet confirmed, used to scale up recent confirmed case numbers, is uncertain and relies on the observed delays to confirmation remaining constant over the course of the outbreak.
* These results are impacted by changes in testing effort, increases and decreases in testing effort will increase and decrease reproduction number estimates respectively (see Methods for further explanation).
* An international reporting delay was assumed. The report delay is likely to vary across and within countries so this assumption is likely to introduce bias.
* Countries are only included in the reported estimates if at least 100 confirmed cases have been reported in a single day. Regions within countries are only reported if at least 40 confirmed cases have been reported in a single day.
