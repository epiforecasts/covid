## 2020-05-17

* Added regional estimates for Brazil and India
* Approximate sampling is now adaptive. Sampling is exact when cases are below 10,000 in a region and after this point it is approximate.
* Incubation period is now explicitly sampled from with right-truncation dealt with in the same way as for imputed onsets. 
* Time window for the effective reproduction window is now optimised at every time point.
* Changed to using a generation time estimate rather than a serial interval estimate (deals with the enforced positivity of the serial interval). 
* Switched to using the `forecastHybrid` package for generating forecasts as the `fable` package was shown to have a memory leak when used at scale. 
* Moved to using a quasipoisson model for estimating the rate of growth and the doubling time.
* Corrected the sources for the UK and German regional data sources.
    
## 2020-05-02

* Switched to approximate sampling of the delay distribution.
* Forecasts are now only shown for countries/regions that have reported at least 200 cases in the last 7 days. 

## 2020-04-25 

* Added short term forecasting results.
* Fixed Germany regional map.
* Update plots.
* Fixed doubling time confidence intervals.
* Update palette.

## 2020-04-18

* Updated the UK data source.
* Fixed data extraction for German regions
* Reduced the lower bound on the number of cases needed to be included in the global nowcast from 100 to 60. 
* Squashed the NA category from appearing in the USA map.

## 2020-04-09

* Updated all estimates with latest data.
* Corrected a mismatch between the data used for the USA on national and statewide level. 
* Added additional text explaining why estimates are lagged.
* Updated wording to highlight date of estiamtes.

## 2020-03-31

* New website to display results.
* Regional breakdowns added for Germany, United Kingdom, and the United States of America.
* National estimates added for all countries that have reported at least 100 cases in a day.
* Update approach to optimise the window used when estimating the Reproduction number.
