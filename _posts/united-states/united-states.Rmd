## National summary

```{r}
## Control parameters for region-report
summary_tables <- 0
summary_figures <- 1
title_depth <- 3
index <- 1
region <- "united-states"
path <- "_posts/global"
show_title <- FALSE
```

```{r,  child = "../../templates/_region-report.Rmd"}
```


## Regional Breakdown

### Data availability

* Case counts by date, stratified by region [@NCoVUtils].
* Case onset dates were estimated using case counts by date of report and a distribution of reporting delays fitted to a publically available line-list of cases reported in the United States [@kraemer2020epidemiological; @NCoVUtils].

### Limitations

* Line-list data to inform a State specific estimates of the reporting delay were not available. 


```{r} 
region_reports <- TRUE
path <- "_posts/united-states"
