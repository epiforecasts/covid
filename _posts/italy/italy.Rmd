## Regional Breakdown

### Data availability

* Case counts by date, stratified by region, were constructed from daily datasets made publically available by the Dipartimento della Protezione Civile [@italydata; @NCoVUtils].
* Case onset dates were estimated using case counts by date of report and a distribution of reporting delays fitted to a European line-list [@kraemer2020epidemiological; @NCoVUtils].

### Expected daily cases by region

```{r}
summary_table <- readRDS ("nowcast/summary/summary_table.rds")
region_codes <- readRDS("nowcast/data/region_codes.rds")
```

```{r map, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, layout="l-body-outset"}
summary_table %>% 
  dplyr::rename(region  = Region) %>% 
  dplyr::left_join(region_codes, by = "region") %>% 
  EpiNow::country_map(country = "Italy", variable = "Expected change in daily cases") +
  ggplot2::guides(fill = ggplot2::guide_legend(title = "Expected change in daily cases",
                                               ncol = 2))
