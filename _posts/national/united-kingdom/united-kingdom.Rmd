## National summary

## Control parameters for region-report

title_depth <- 3
index <- 1

```


## Regional Breakdown

### Data availability

* Case counts by date, stratified by region, were downloaded from a public curated dataset [@doughty_visualisation_2020; @NCoVUtils].
* Case onset dates were estimated using case counts by date of report and a distribution of reporting delays fitted to an international line-list [@kraemer2020epidemiological; @NCoVUtils].

### Limitations

* Line-list data to inform a United Kingdom specific estimate of the reporting delay was not available. This means that we could also not account for any regional differences.
