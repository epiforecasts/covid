title: "National and Subnational estimates for the United Kingdom"
description: |
  Identifying changes in the reproduction number, rate of spread, and doubling time during the course of the COVID-19 outbreak whilst accounting for potential biases due to delays in case reporting both nationally and subnationally in the United Kingdom. These results are impacted by changes in testing effort, increases and decreases in testing effort will increase and decrease reproduction number estimates respectively.

## Using Rt to explore transmission in vulnerable populations

### Comparing cases, admissions, and deaths data
We calculate Rt as the average of how many new infections arise from one infected person. However, each data source for Covid-19 infections (test-positive cases, hospital admissions, or deaths) represents a slightly different type of "average" person who has been infected. For example, when most new infections are spread between young people who may be less vulnerable to severe disease, the Rt from all test-positive cases rises quicker than the Rt calculated from patients in hospital. This happened in the UK in August. This comparison can help us track in real-time how Covid-19 is spreading in the most vulnerable populations. 

To explore in more depth how Rt from different data sources can be used to understand transmission dynamics across the population, and a more detailed methodology, see our pre-print [@rt-comparison].

## Regional Breakdown

### Data availability

-   Case counts by date, stratified by region, were downloaded from a public curated dataset [@noauthor_coronavirus_2020; @white_coronavirus_2020; @covidregionaldata].
-   Case onset dates were estimated using confirmed case counts by date of report and a distribution of reporting delays fitted to an international line-list [@kraemer2020epidemiological; @covidregionaldata].

### Limitations

-   Line-list data to inform a United Kingdom specific estimate of the reporting delay was not available. This means that we could also not account for any regional differences.

```{r}
region_path <- NULL
case_def <- "case"
folder <- "united-kingdom"
summary_path <- file.path("covid-rt-estimates/subnational", folder, "cases/summary")
fig_start <- fig_start + 1
tab_start <- tab_start + 1
```

```{r,  child = system.file("templates/_regional-summary.Rmd", package = "EpiNow2")}
