## National summary

```{r}
## Control parameters for region-report
summary_tables <- 0
summary_figures <- 1
title_depth <- 3
index <- 1
region <- "united-kingdom"
path <- "_posts/global"
show_title <- FALSE
```

```{r,  child = "../../templates/_region-report.Rmd"}
```


## Regional Breakdown

### Data availability

* Case counts by date, stratified by region, were constructed from daily datasets made publically available by the  [@NCoVUtils].
* Case onset dates were estimated using case counts by date of report and a distribution of reporting delays fitted to a European line-list [@kraemer2020epidemiological; @NCoVUtils].

### Limitations

* Line-list data to inform a United Kingdom specific estimate of the reporting delay was not available. This means that we could also not account for any regional differences.
